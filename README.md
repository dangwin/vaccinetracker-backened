# README

This project was inspired by what was going on in the world. It is a patient/vaccine tracker that allows a user to add patients the database and with each patient attach a side effect (if any) they may have experienced after their vaccine. To run the app:

Fork and clone the backend of the app which is this file.

Next go over to the frontend here:

https://github.com/dangwin/vaccinetracker-frontend

Fork and clone. 

Run rails s on the backend file and open index.html on the frontend file.

Enjoy.
